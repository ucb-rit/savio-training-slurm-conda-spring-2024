# savio-training-slurm-conda-spring-2024

Materials for Savio intermediate training on Slurm and Conda/Mamba, April 18, 2024.

## Material on the web / in html

You can see the (very basic) webpage for the training at `https://tinyurl.com/brc-apr24-web`.

The main documents are `slurm.html` and `conda.html` (or `slurm_onepage.html` and `conda_onepage.html` if you prefer a version that appears in one long HTML page rather than in slide format).

  - To directly view the (one-page) Slurm HTML, please [click here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-slurm-conda-spring-2024/blob/main/slurm.html).
